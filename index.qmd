# Welcome to my website!

My name is Dario Cabal, a graduate of Case Western Reserve University with my B.S in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Biomedical Engineering. On this website, I offer some insight onto my skill set, ongoing research, and publications.

My research interests span the development of state-of-the-art Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) design for implantable devices along with the the development and deployment of other implantable devices. And I already am listed as a secondary author on several publications relating towards implantable devices.

On this website, you will find a selection of my published works. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me and my pursuits.
Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.dxc553@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
